![Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1accb779-ca8d-46bf-80dd-cb1476c5a5e6)

## Project Background

As a Freelance Data Analyst, I was tasked with creating an insightful KPI report for the executive team of a global coffee distributor. **This report analyzes sales performance data from 2019 to 2021 across various regions, customer demographics, and product categories, comprising over 28,000 records**. The primary goal was to identify trends, top-performing products, regional contributions, and customer behavior to inform data-driven strategic decisions.

## Executive Summary

The analysis highlights key sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. **The United States emerged as the top-performing region, contributing over 70% of total sales**, while products like **Arabica Light Roast in larger sizes** demonstrated the highest profitability. Seasonal trends reveal peak sales during specific months, providing opportunities for targeted promotions. Additionally, **uninsured customers in Ireland and the United Kingdom show high spending habits**, emphasizing the need for region-specific strategies.

## Insights Deep-Dive

### **Sales Trends and Growth Rates Over Time**
- The dataset spans three years, from 2019 to 2021.
- Sales exhibit **seasonal spikes**, with January and December showing higher volumes.  
- Sales grew annually by **5% from 2019 to 2020**, likely influenced by pandemic-related changes in consumer behavior, but dipped slightly in 2021.

### **Key Product Performance**
- **Arabica Light Roast** products led in revenue, especially larger sizes (1kg and 2.5kg) with high profitability margins (~25%).
- Robusta and Excelsa medium roasts performed well in volume sales but had lower margins.
- Smaller-sized products (0.2kgâ€“0.5kg) contribute less to overall profitability despite significant sales volume.

### **Sales by Countries**
- **United States**: Leading contributor with ~$35,638 in sales, showing steady growth and preference for Arabica and medium roasts.
- **Ireland**: Contributed ~$6,697, showing preferences for Excelsa and Robusta products.
- **United Kingdom**: Generated ~$2,798, with balanced preferences across product categories.

### **Top 5 Customers**

## Recommendations

1. **Leverage Seasonal Trends**: Capitalize on high-demand months (October, September in avg) with promotions and product bundling.
2. **Increase Inventory of High-Profit Products**: Focus on larger-sized Arabica products, especially light roast, to maximize profitability.
3. **Regional Marketing Strategy**: Develop targeted campaigns for Ireland and the United Kingdom to increase engagement and tap into existing preferences.
4. **Customer Retention Programs**: Introduce loyalty programs for top customers who have not yet joined to encourage repeat purchases and foster brand loyalty.
5. **Expand Uninsured Customer Base**: Provide flexible payment options or discounts in regions with uninsured high spenders to boost sales.

## Key Questions for Stakeholders Prior to Project Advancement

> These are some questions I would've loved to ask stakeholders/project leads to learn more about their own needs/existing knowledge on the objective at hand:

- Are there specific KPIs that should be prioritized (e.g., profit margins, regional growth)?
- Should the focus be on volume sales or profitability for strategic decisions?
- How do external factors like market trends or economic conditions impact sales in different regions?
