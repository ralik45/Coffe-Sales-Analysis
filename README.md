# Coffee Sales Analysis - Tailored KPI Report

## Project Background

As a Freelance Data Analyst, I was tasked with creating an insightful KPI report for the executive team of a global coffee distributor. **This report analyzes sales performance data from 2019 to 2021 across various regions, customer demographics, and product categories, comprising over 28,000 records**. The primary goal was to identify trends, top-performing products, regional contributions, and customer behavior to inform data-driven strategic decisions.

## Executive Summary

The analysis highlights key sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. **The United States emerged as the top-performing region, contributing over 70% of total sales**, while products like **Arabica Light Roast in larger sizes** demonstrated the highest profitability. Seasonal trends reveal peak sales during specific months, providing opportunities for targeted promotions. Additionally, **uninsured customers in Ireland and the United Kingdom show high spending habits**, emphasizing the need for region-specific strategies.

## Insights Deep-Dive

### **Sales Trends and Growth Rates Over Time**

- Sales exhibit **seasonal spikes**, with January and December showing higher volumes.  
- Sales grew annually by **5% from 2019 to 2020**, likely influenced by pandemic-related changes in consumer behavior, but dipped slightly in 2021.

### **Key Product Performance**
- **Arabica Light Roast** products led in revenue, especially larger sizes (1kg and 2.5kg) with high profitability margins (~25%).
- Robusta and Excelsa medium roasts performed well in volume sales but had lower margins.
- Smaller-sized products (0.2kgâ€“0.5kg) contribute less to overall profitability despite significant sales volume.

### **Sales by Countries**

## Recommendations

## Key Questions for Stakeholders Prior to Project Advancement

> To align the analysis with organizational goals, these are key questions for stakeholders:

- Are there specific KPIs that should be prioritized (e.g., profit margins, regional growth)?
- Should the focus be on volume sales or profitability for strategic decisions?
- How do external factors like market trends or economic conditions impact sales in different regions?

---

## Assumptions and Caveats

- **Product profitability** assumes consistent manufacturing and operational costs across regions.
- **Seasonal trends** are inferred based on historical data and may not fully predict future performance.
- **Customer data**: Loyalty card status and other demographic attributes were used to identify customer behavior trends but may not reflect long-term patterns.
- The analysis excluded unrecorded sales channels or promotional discounts that could influence profitability and growth.
